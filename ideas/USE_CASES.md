# Potential Use Cases

We'll go through a bunch of far-out use cases for sitepipes that are likely many years away. The point is to think about extreme scenarios to create a generalized framework for solving certain types of problems. These considerations are meant to be extendable, that is they don't all have to be done now rather than possible at some point.

## Personal Assistants

Imagine if we could have our phones learn from all our personal data. While keeping that juicy data on our phones. We could build Jarvis-like personal assistants that are tailored to our unique data signature.

Some things that would be required to work:

* Able to run on thousands or millions of devices
* Access to personal data on device
* Able to aggregate thousnds or millions of models

## Asteroid Mining

Imagine if we could send out autonomous mining drones to resource-rich asteroids. There would be far too much sensor data to transmit all back to Earth. We would rather store the data on each mining drone and train models there too.

Some things that would be required to work:

* Interfaces with various types of machinery
* Operates with complete autonomy
* Accepts wireless communication protocols
* Processes streaming data from sensors

## UX Optimization

Imagine if we could create front-end components that learn to modify themselves to improve the user experience. It measures how users interact with each web component and trains models in the browser to improve that interaction.


Some things that would be required to work:

* Integrates with front-end frameworks
* 

## Type Assist

Imagine if our computers could finish our thoughts while typing. We only have to hit tab to accept its suggestion. This is a project that I'm currently working on and it's built on the sitepipes framework. Check out the [Github](https://github.com/MedleyLabs/TypeAssist)!

Some things that would be required to work:

* Inference speed under 100ms
*
